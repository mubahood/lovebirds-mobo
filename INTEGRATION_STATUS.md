## ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING BACKEND WORK

The UI integration is complete, but these backend API endpoints need to be implemented:

1. **User Blocking API:**
   - `POST /api/block-user` 
   - Parameters: `userId`, `blockedUserId`, `duration`, `reason`

2. **User Reporting API:**
   - `POST /api/report-user`
   - Parameters: `reportedUserId`, `category`, `details`, `reporterId`

3. **Block Management:**
   - Database table for user blocks
   - Block expiration handling
   - UI filtering of blocked users

4. **Report Management:**
   - Database table for user reports
   - Moderation dashboard for admin review
   - Report status tracking

## üéâ iOS APP STORE COMPLIANCE

This integration addresses several App Store rejection issues:

- ‚úÖ **User Safety**: Users can now report inappropriate behavior
- ‚úÖ **Content Moderation**: Blocking mechanism prevents unwanted interactions  
- ‚úÖ **Community Guidelines**: Clear reporting categories align with App Store requirements
- ‚úÖ **User Control**: Users have control over their experience and safety

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

With the UI integration complete, the next phase should focus on:

1. Backend API implementation for blocking/reporting
2. Database schema for user moderation data
3. Admin moderation dashboard
4. Testing the complete flow end-to-end
5. Content filtering system integration

The BlockUserDialog and ReportContentDialog are now successfully integrated and ready for users to interact with once the backend support is implemented.
