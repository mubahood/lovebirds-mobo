RxList<CartItem> cartItems = <CartItem>[].obs;
RxInt itemCount = 0.obs;
RxDouble subtotal = 0.0.obs;
RxDouble tax = 0.0.obs;
RxString deliveryMethod = 'pickup'.obs;

// Computed properties for automatic calculations
double get total => subtotal.value + tax + actualDeliveryFee;
double get actualDeliveryFee => deliveryMethod.value == 'pickup' ? 0.0 : deliveryFee.value;
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Controllers
```dart
// In your main app or initial screen
Get.put(CartController());
Get.put(MainController());
```

### Step 2: Add Items to Cart
```dart
// From product screens
CartItem cartItem = CartItem();
cartItem.product_id = product.id.toString();
cartItem.product_name = product.name;
cartItem.product_price_1 = product.price.toString();
cartItem.product_quantity = quantity.toString();
await cartItem.save();
await cartController.loadCartItems();
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Cart
```dart
Get.to(() => const ImprovedCartScreen());
```

### Step 4: Proceed to Checkout
```dart
OrderOnline order = OrderOnline();
// Set order details...
Get.to(() => ImprovedCheckoutScreen(order));
```
