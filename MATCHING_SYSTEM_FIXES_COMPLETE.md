## 🔧 **BACKEND IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED**

### 1. **Lenient Discovery Algorithm**
```php
// OLD: Strict 40% minimum score, tight filters
$minScore = 40; // Too strict!

// NEW: Generous 10% minimum score, expanded filters  
$minScore = 10; // Much more lenient!
```

### 2. **Smart Gender Mapping**
```php
$genderMapping = [
    'Women' => 'Female',
    'Woman' => 'Female', 
    'Men' => 'Male',
    'Man' => 'Male',
    // Handles all common variants
];
```

### 3. **Enhanced Scoring System**
- **Location**: Base score increased from 10→15 points (more generous)
- **Interests**: Base score increased from 5→10 points (more generous)  
- **Age**: Base score increased from 5→10 points (more generous)
- **Distance**: Expanded ranges, better scoring for far users

### 4. **Relaxed Filtering**
- **Age Range**: Expanded by ±5 years from user preferences
- **Distance**: Doubled maximum distance (or 100km default)
- **Gender**: Proper mapping between app terms and database values

```

### 2. **Poor Matches UI → Premium Design**
```dart
// OLD
backgroundColor: LovebirdsTheme.background
elevation: 8
margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 6)

// NEW
gradient: LinearGradient([primary, accent, pink])
elevation: 12 with color-matched shadows
sophisticated spacing and animations
```

### 3. **Gender Mapping Issue → Intelligent Mapping**
```php
// FIXED: "Women" → "Female" conversion
$mappedGender = $genderMapping[$currentUser->interested_in] ?? $currentUser->interested_in;
