## ⚠️ **CURRENT ISSUE: IMPORT PATH UPDATES NEEDED**

### **Expected Issue After Package Name Change:**
The package name change from `ugflix` to `lovebirds_app` requires updating all import statements:

**Old Pattern:** `package:ugflix/path/to/file.dart`  
**New Pattern:** `package:lovebirds_app/path/to/file.dart`

### **Files Requiring Import Updates:**
- 895 import issues found (expected after package rename)
- All internal package imports need systematic update
- External package imports remain unchanged (dependencies)

## 🚀 **STRATEGIC DECISION: CONTINUE OR REVERT?**

### **Option 1: Complete Import Updates (RECOMMENDED)**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Achieves complete app branding transformation
- ✅ Professional dating app identity established
- ✅ Canadian market ready (CAD currency)
- ✅ All functionality preserved (imports just need path updates)

**Process:**
1. Systematically update package imports using find/replace
2. Update ~100-200 files with correct import paths
3. Test build after import corrections
4. Validate all features still work

**Time Estimate:** ~30-45 minutes for systematic import updates

### **Option 2: Revert Package Name (QUICK)**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate build restoration
- ✅ Quick testing of current functionality

**Cons:**
- ❌ Loses professional branding
- ❌ Still shows "UGFlix" throughout app
- ❌ Delays user experience transformation

2. **Validate:** Ensure app builds after import corrections
3. **Test:** Verify dating functionality still works
4. **Continue:** Move to navigation restructuring (Phase 1.3)
