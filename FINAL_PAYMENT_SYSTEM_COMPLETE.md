## 🔗 **Backend Integration**

### API Endpoints Used:
1. **`generate-payment-link`**: Creates Stripe payment URLs
2. **`order-details`**: Checks payment status updates
3. **Existing Stripe integration**: Processes actual payments

### Payment URL Generation:
```dart
RespondModel resp = RespondModel(
  await Utils.http_post('generate-payment-link', {
    'order_id': widget.order.id.toString(),
  }),
);
```

### Payment Status Monitoring:
```dart
RespondModel resp = RespondModel(
  await Utils.http_get('order-details', {
    'order_id': widget.order.id.toString(),
  }),
);
```

## 📋 **Payment Button Logic (FIXED)**

### Priority Order:
1. **PRIORITY 1**: "Pay Now" - when payment URL exists and not paid
2. **PRIORITY 2**: "Payment" - when not paid and no URL (generates new link)  
3. **PRIORITY 3**: "Track Order" - when paid and processing

### Before (BROKEN):
```dart
if (unpaid && hasURL) → "Pay Now"
else if (pending || processing) → "Track Order" ❌ WRONG!
else if (unpaid && noURL) → "Generate Payment" ❌ NEVER REACHED!
```

### After (FIXED):
```dart
if (unpaid && hasURL) → "Pay Now" ✅
else if (unpaid && noURL) → "Payment" ✅  
else if (paid && processing) → "Track Order" ✅
```

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**
