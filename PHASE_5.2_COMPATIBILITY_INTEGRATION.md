// NEW: Enhanced with compatibility
CompatibilityEnhancedSwipeCard(
  user: user,
  onLike: () => _performSwipe('like'),
  onSuperLike: () => _performSwipe('super_like'),
  onPass: () => _performSwipe('pass'),
)
```

#### 2. Add Compatibility Indicator to Existing Cards

```dart
// Add this to your existing swipe card Stack
Positioned(
  top: 16,
  right: 16,
  child: CompatibilityIndicator(
    targetUser: user,
    size: 48,
  ),
),
```

#### 3. Smart Swipe Recommendations

```dart
// Get AI-powered swipe suggestions
final suggestion = SwipeService.getSuggestedAction(currentUser, targetUser);
// Returns: 'super_like', 'like', or 'pass'

// Show smart recommendation
if (suggestion == 'super_like') {
  _showSuperLikeRecommendation();
}
```

print('Score: ${potential.score}%');
print('Level: ${potential.level}');
print('Recommendation: ${potential.recommendation}');
```
